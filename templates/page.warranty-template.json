Because we believe in the durability and enduring appeal of our products, we are proud to offer a lifetime warranty on our leather bags and accessories.<br/><br/>Each product may vary slightly in color or texture, due to the particularity of the tanning process and the natural products used. We do not consider it a defect, but rather a token of uniqueness. To ensure the authenticity of our products, we provide a Certificate of Guarantee. This guarantees that our leather has been tanned exclusively with natural tannins of vegetable origin and does not contain substances prohibited by law. Tannin extracts are the fundamental ingredients of the slow tanning process and give the best quality. Each item is carefully crafted and undergoes accurate quality control. Small veins, wrinkles and imperceptible scratches that eventually present on the leather prove its naturalness, rendering each skin one of a kind.</p>",
